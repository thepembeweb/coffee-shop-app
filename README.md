The application showcases the following features:

* Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
* Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
* Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
* Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
* Object-oriented thinking in Python, including abstract classes, class methods, and static methods.
* DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles of class and method design.
* Working with modules and packages in Python.
* Coding best practices for style and documentation
* Ensuring that code, docstrings, and comments adhere to [PEP 8 Standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
